The game ends when there is only one player left on the board or when the set time has passed. The player with the most points wins. Points can be scored in many ways: by hitting or eliminating the opponent or even by moving (no campers). At the beginning, players move in a completely random way, but with the help of a genetic algorithm, on the basis of the best individuals (with the most points) we create new generations of players, who are already more \"taught\" how to eliminate opponents and not be hit. Because the learning process is long in the game it is possible to run an accelerated simulation of x iterations of the game, and then select the standard game mode to see what behavior the players have learned.",
